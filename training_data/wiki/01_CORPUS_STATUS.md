# Corpus Status

For the canonical overall training sequence, see `docs/training_pipeline.md`.
This file is the history-and-status record for wiki corpus work, not the active todo list.

## What we're building

A Level 1 training corpus for the BDH (Baby Dragon Hatchling) language model.
Each entry follows this format:

```
[user]what is a X?
[assistant]5-6 simple sentences. Identity + 2-3 concrete facts + 1 contrast.
X is not Y.
```

**Target level:** simple child-facing language, roughly preschool to 1st grade in tone, with room to grow later. No jargon, no Latin taxonomy, no encyclopedic depth.
**Contrast rule:** Every entry ends with "X is not Y." Both X and Y must be defined somewhere in the corpus (no dangling contrasts).

## Files and their status

### Clean and aligned to current Level 1 target

## Functional role groups

These groups are for balance evaluation, not for strict ontology.
The goal is to judge size against function, not to force every file toward the same entry count.

### Core generative infrastructure

These categories carry general sentence-building, reasoning, description, and everyday regulation load.
High depth is expected here, because these files support many other domains.

- `abstract_operators_entries.md`, `agreement_and_disagreement_entries.md`, `body_parts_entries.md`, `body_states_and_internal_cues_entries.md`, `colors_entries.md`, `communication_acts_and_language_entries.md`, `directions_and_navigation_entries.md`, `emotions_entries.md`, `greetings_and_social_salutations_entries.md`, `health_and_wellness_entries.md`, `logic_entries.md`, `mathematical_concepts_entries.md`, `measurement_and_comparison_entries.md`, `movement_and_physical_action_entries.md`, `people_roles_entries.md`, `personal_identity_and_self_description_entries.md`, `sensory_experiences_entries.md`, `space_entries.md`, `states_of_being_and_condition_entries.md`, `time_entries.md`, `topology_parts_entries.md`, `uncertainty_and_guessing_entries.md`, `verbs_entries.md`, `waiting_and_patience_entries.md`, `wants_needs_and_preferences_entries.md`

### World-anchor inventories

These files mainly give the model enough breadth to recognize and talk about common parts of the world.
They usually want broad passive coverage, but not exhaustive encyclopedic depth.

- `animal_care_and_pet_keeping_entries.md`, `animal_habitats_and_homes_entries.md`, `animals_birds_entries.md`, `animals_fish_entries.md`, `animals_insects_arthropods_entries.md`, `animals_mammals_entries.md`, `animals_reptiles_amphibians_entries.md`, `classroom_objects_and_school_tools_entries.md`, `clothing_and_apparel_entries.md`, `community_places_and_services_entries.md`, `food_groups_and_nutrition_entries.md`, `foods_and_drinks_entries.md`, `foods_fruits_entries.md`, `foods_vegetables_entries.md`, `garden_and_planting_basics_entries.md`, `home_objects_entries_part1.md`, `home_objects_entries_part2.md`, `home_objects_entries_part3.md`, `home_rooms_entries.md`, `machines_and_simple_mechanisms_entries.md`, `material_composition_entries.md`, `musical_instruments_entries.md`, `numbers_beyond_10_and_large_number_talk_entries.md`, `places_and_landforms_entries.md`, `plants_and_nature_entries.md`, `professions_entries.md`, `school_life_and_learning_entries.md`, `simple_physics_energy_and_power_entries.md`, `tools_and_kitchenware_entries.md`, `vehicles_transport_entries.md`, `weather_and_celestial_entries.md`

### Example-bearing pragmatic and social sets

These categories work best as representative sets of common patterns, scripts, and situations.
They usually do not need huge inventories; too much depth here can create odd weighting or redundancy.

- `accidents_and_mistakes_entries.md`, `art_and_creative_expression_entries.md`, `boundaries_and_consent_entries.md`, `chores_and_home_responsibilities_entries.md`, `civic_responsibility_and_community_rules_entries.md`, `collections_and_collecting_entries.md`, `conflict_resolution_and_relationship_repair_entries.md`, `construction_and_material_transformations_entries.md`, `cooking_and_food_preparation_entries.md`, `daily_routines_and_self_care_entries.md`, `environmental_care_and_stewardship_entries.md`, `evidence_and_justification_entries.md`, `friends_and_peer_interactions_entries.md`, `future_planning_and_goals_entries.md`, `growth_and_life_stages_human_entries.md`, `hobbies_and_interests_entries.md`, `holidays_and_celebrations_entries.md`, `humor_and_figurative_language_entries.md`, `imagination_and_pretend_play_entries.md`, `inclusion_bullying_and_kindness_entries.md`, `learning_memory_and_metacognition_entries.md`, `meals_and_mealtime_talk_entries.md`, `money_trade_and_shopping_entries.md`, `online_safety_and_privacy_entries.md`, `opinions_persuasion_and_simple_debate_entries.md`, `ownership_and_sharing_entries.md`, `play_games_and_sports_entries.md`, `praise_criticism_and_feedback_entries.md`, `safety_rules_and_emergency_awareness_entries.md`, `safety_signs_and_symbols_entries.md`, `seasonal_activities_entries.md`, `secrets_surprises_and_keeping_promises_entries.md`, `sibling_relationships_and_dynamics_entries.md`, `sleep_and_rest_entries.md`, `social_emotional_learning_competencies_entries.md`, `technology_and_digital_media_entries.md`

### Bridge and modifier categories

These files connect, qualify, structure, or lightly abstract other knowledge.
They should usually stay compact and high-signal unless repeated use shows a real need for expansion.

- `categories_and_grouping_entries.md`, `containers_and_capacity_entries.md`, `data_charts_and_graphs_entries.md`, `degrees_of_truth_entries.md`, `exceptions_and_qualifications_entries.md`, `fractions_and_sharing_quantities_entries.md`, `group_roles_and_participation_entries.md`, `intentions_and_plans_in_action_entries.md`, `levels_of_intensity_and_gradation_entries.md`, `location_and_direction_in_action_entries.md`, `natural_life_cycles_and_processes_entries.md`, `perspective_taking_and_theory_of_mind_entries.md`, `STEM_entries.md`, `story_roles_and_plot_elements_entries.md`, `storytelling_and_narrative_structure_entries.md`

### Working interpretation

- `Core generative infrastructure` can justifiably be large.
- `World-anchor inventories` should be broad enough for passive recognition and common recall, but not encyclopedic.
- `Example-bearing pragmatic and social sets` should usually stay selective and representative.
- `Bridge and modifier categories` should stay tight unless repeated corpus use proves they need more depth.

## Dependencies

This section is about learning readiness.
The question is not only "what does this file contain?"
The question is also "what should the model already understand before this file is likely to teach cleanly?"

### Dependency types

- **Vocabulary prerequisites:** concrete words the file will rely on directly, such as body parts, common objects, motion words, or basic time words.
- **Concept prerequisites:** earlier ideas the file builds on, such as category membership, part-whole reasoning, cause and effect, ownership, or sequence.
- **Pragmatic prerequisites:** social or discourse habits the file assumes, such as turn-taking, repair, asking, comparing, or perspective-shifting.

### Dependency profile by role

#### Core generative infrastructure

These files should usually come earliest or be reinforced repeatedly, because many later files depend on them.

- Typical vocabulary prerequisites: high-frequency body, object, place, and action words
- Typical concept prerequisites: very light; many of these files are themselves prerequisites for the rest of the corpus
- Typical pragmatic prerequisites: minimal; these often establish the core interaction layer
- Examples:
  - `time_entries.md` depends on basic event language and sequence words
  - `space_entries.md` depends on concrete object language and location talk
  - `logic_entries.md` depends on stable concrete examples before abstract contrasts will make sense
  - `emotions_entries.md` depends on simple people-and-event understanding before more nuanced feeling labels become useful

These files usually depend on the core layer being stable first.
A model needs enough general language to attach the inventory items to something meaningful.

- Typical vocabulary prerequisites: basic nouns, adjectives, and action words
- Typical concept prerequisites: category membership, part-whole structure, simple function or habitat reasoning
- Typical pragmatic prerequisites: low; these are more recognition-heavy than interaction-heavy
- Examples:
  - `animals_birds_entries.md` depends on the broader idea of `animal`, visible body-part words, and simple habitat/action language
  - `musical_instruments_entries.md` depends on object language, sound words, and action words like play, hit, blow, or hold
  - `community_places_and_services_entries.md` depends on person-role and action-function language
  - `material_composition_entries.md` depends on object recognition plus `made of` or part-material reasoning

#### Example-bearing pragmatic and social sets

These files need the model to already have enough core language to understand the script, not just the words.
They are often late because they combine feeling, intention, consequence, and social repair.

- Typical vocabulary prerequisites: feelings, action words, time words, person-role language
- Typical concept prerequisites: cause and effect, goals, rules, ownership, fairness, truth, and choice
- Typical pragmatic prerequisites: turn-taking, asking, answering, reacting, apologizing, or interpreting another person's move
- Examples:
  - `conflict_resolution_and_relationship_repair_entries.md` depends on emotions, problem/solution logic, and peer interaction language
  - `online_safety_and_privacy_entries.md` depends on rules, boundaries, technology words, and trusted-adult framing
  - `praise_criticism_and_feedback_entries.md` depends on action quality, goals, effort, and evaluation language
  - `secrets_surprises_and_keeping_promises_entries.md` depends on truth, trust, intention, and safety reasoning

#### Bridge and modifier categories

These files usually depend on both vocabulary and structure already being present.
They do not stand well on their own because their job is to qualify or organize other knowledge.

- Typical vocabulary prerequisites: enough noun and verb coverage to have something to sort, compare, qualify, or divide
- Typical concept prerequisites: same/different, part-whole, degree, category, rule, sequence, or evidence
- Typical pragmatic prerequisites: often medium; many of these support explanation rather than basic naming
- Examples:
  - `categories_and_grouping_entries.md` depends on having multiple stable object domains already learned
  - `degrees_of_truth_entries.md` depends on truth-language, uncertainty, and comparison
  - `fractions_and_sharing_quantities_entries.md` depends on number language plus part-whole and fairness
  - `story_roles_and_plot_elements_entries.md` depends on `storytelling_and_narrative_structure_entries.md`, emotion language, and problem/solution logic

### Representative dependency chains

These are not strict one-file-only pipelines.
They are working examples of the kinds of dependencies the wiki should respect.

- `body_parts_entries.md` -> `body_states_and_internal_cues_entries.md` -> `health_and_wellness_entries.md`
- `space_entries.md` -> `directions_and_navigation_entries.md` -> `location_and_direction_in_action_entries.md`
- `people_roles_entries.md` -> `friends_and_peer_interactions_entries.md` -> `conflict_resolution_and_relationship_repair_entries.md`
- `logic_entries.md` -> `uncertainty_and_guessing_entries.md` -> `degrees_of_truth_entries.md` -> `evidence_and_justification_entries.md`
- `foods_and_drinks_entries.md` -> `meals_and_mealtime_talk_entries.md` -> `food_groups_and_nutrition_entries.md`
- `plants_and_nature_entries.md` -> `garden_and_planting_basics_entries.md` -> `environmental_care_and_stewardship_entries.md`
- `animals_*` core files -> `animal_habitats_and_homes_entries.md` -> `animal_care_and_pet_keeping_entries.md`
- `storytelling_and_narrative_structure_entries.md` -> `story_roles_and_plot_elements_entries.md` -> `humor_and_figurative_language_entries.md`
- `communication_acts_and_language_entries.md` -> `agreement_and_disagreement_entries.md` -> `praise_criticism_and_feedback_entries.md`
- `ownership_and_sharing_entries.md` -> `fractions_and_sharing_quantities_entries.md` -> `fairness`-heavy social files such as `sibling_relationships_and_dynamics_entries.md`

### Working use

This section should be used in three ways:

- before adding new entries to ask whether the file has enough earlier support
- during cleanup to see whether a file is too abstract for its current prerequisites
- during balance review to decide whether a sparse file is actually underbuilt or simply waiting on earlier concepts

For file-specific dependency notes, `training_data/wiki/wiki_category_backlog.md` remains the detailed category-level source of truth.

## Design principles

- **Vocabulary dependency:** No word appears in a problem or entry before it has been defined elsewhere in the corpus.
- **Bidirectional contrasts:** If entry A says "A is not B", entry B should exist and ideally say "B is not A."
- **No computation math** in concept files. Math concepts file covers number/shape/operation as language. Math problems file covers grade 1 arithmetic with known vocabulary only.
- **Cross-domain linking:** Entries reference other domains naturally (e.g. professions link to tools, animals link to plants).
- **Clear concept ownership:** prefer one canonical `what is X?` home per concept whenever possible.
- **General before specific:** broader anchors should usually appear before narrower concepts inside a file.

## Known dangling contrasts

These words appear as contrast targets (`X is not Y`) but do not yet have their
own entry. Each one is a candidate for later expansion.

| Word | Appears in | Priority |
|---|---|---|

No dangling contrasts currently known. All prior items resolved:
- `tiger`, `magazine`, `fog`, `breeze`, `lightning`, `climate`, `raven`, `plantain` — entries added in earlier passes
- `numeral` — only appeared in deprecated `wiki_level_1.md`; current `mathematical_concepts_entries.md` uses "A number is not a letter"
- `darkness` — entry added to `shadow_and_light_phenomena_entries.md`
- `puddle` — flood contrast changed to "A flood is not rainfall" (within-category fix)

## Completed: Gap-Filling and Trunk Audit Batch (2026-04-16 to 2026-04-18)

This batch established the comprehension infrastructure for the wiki corpus:

### Dependency infrastructure created

- **`dependency_ledger.md`**: Maps ~150 unique dependency concepts to canonical wiki files. Identifies ~15 curriculum-only dependencies (basic objects like door, table, ball). Resolves all ~75 old `(backlog)` markers. Documents 9 ownership overlap hotspots.
- **`ranked_gap_list.md`**: Organizes 36 corpus comprehension gaps into 4 priority tiers. Tier 1 (4 items) flags foundational concepts needing wiki anchors. Tier 2 (8 items) lists ownership splits resolved during trunk audit. Tier 3 (10 items) lists anchors verified during trunk audit. Tier 4 (14 items) confirms curriculum-only basics need no action.

### Trunk files audited

All 8 trunk files passed audit with documented findings:

| File | Entries | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| `logic_entries.md` | 60 | Ownership splits with storytelling documented as intentional. Low-priority overlaps flagged (own/belong, memory). No changes required. |
| `STEM_entries.md` | 51 | All overlaps with verbs, sensory, body-state files documented as intentional. Well-scoped bridge file. No changes required. |
| `time_entries.md` | 35 | begin/middle/end correctly absent (owned elsewhere). before/after/then split with storytelling is intentional. No changes required. |
| `space_entries.md` | 36 | `height` duplicate removed (canonical owner: measurement_and_comparison). width/depth/center/edge/corner unique. No other changes. |
| `verbs_entries.md` | 77 | 5 intentional duplicate anchors with STEM (eat, drink, sleep, see, hear). Clean splits documented. No changes required. |
| `mathematical_concepts_entries.md` | 29 | Concept-only scope confirmed. Clean splits with problems and measurement files. No changes required. |
| `mathematical_problems_entries.md` | 45 | Difficulty stratification issue flagged (numbers 0-15 Level 1, 10-100 bridge, 100-2000+ Level 2/3). Vocabulary grounded. |
| `body_parts_entries.md` | 28 | No drift to body-state or health content. Broad-to-narrow ordering preserved. No changes required. |

### Corpus-wide cleanup completed

- **Contrast verification**: 1,366 contrast statements audited. All point to grounded concepts.
- **Duplicate anchor audit**: 31 duplicates identified. 5 documented intentional splits. 16 contextually acceptable. 10 reviewed and resolved.
- **Concrete cleanup**: `height` removed from space_entries.md. `lever` ownership clarified. School-domain duplicates documented.

### Current state

The wiki corpus is structurally ready for Level 1 finalization:
- All trunk files audited
- Ownership splits documented
- Duplicate anchors resolved or documented
- No blocking issues identified
