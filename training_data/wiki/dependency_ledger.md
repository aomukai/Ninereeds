# Wiki Corpus Dependency Ledger

Generated from `wiki_category_backlog.md` by auditing and normalizing all `Depends on:` items.

Purpose: Track where each dependency concept lives, whether it is grounded in the corpus, and flag gaps.

---

## Ledger Key

- **WIKI**: Dependency has a canonical wiki entry file
- **CURRICULUM**: Concept is grounded in phase 1-5 curriculum only (not wiki)
- **SPLIT**: Concept is split across multiple files; primary owner listed
- **MISSING**: No grounded anchor exists
- **ALIAS**: Listed term is an alias; see canonical entry

## Comprehension-Critical Missing or Weak Prerequisites

This section identifies concepts that many files depend on but are either missing anchors, have weak definitions, or need clarification. Priority is based on how many files depend on the concept and how central it is to understanding the corpus.

### Priority 1: High-impact conceptual gaps (many dependencies)

These concepts underpin much of the corpus and need strong anchors:

| Concept | Current Status | Impact | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|--------|----------------|
| `person` | WIKI (people_roles_entries.md) | Very high — nearly all social files | Confirm anchor is clear and early in file |
| `thing` / `object` | No wiki anchor | Very high — implicit prerequisite | Consider adding to abstract_operators_entries.md as foundational anchor |
| `animal` | WIKI (animals_mammals_entries.md) | Very high — all animal files depend on it | Confirm anchor is stable |
| `place` | WIKI (places_and_landforms_entries.md) | High — geography and space files | Confirm anchor is clear |
| `idea` / `thought` | Weak — `thought` only in missing_curriculum_terms.md | Medium-high — logic, learning, communication | Add entry to logic_entries.md or consider curriculum placement |
| `word` | No wiki anchor | Medium-high — communication and language files | Add to communication_acts_and_language_entries.md |
| `sentence` | No wiki anchor | Medium — storytelling and communication files | Add to communication_acts_and_language_entries.md |

### Priority 2: Curriculum-only concepts that need verification

These are grounded in phase 1-5 curriculum only, not wiki. Verify they are solid enough for files that depend on them:

| Concept | Curriculum Anchor | Dependent Wiki Files | Risk Level |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|------------|
| `fire` | phase 1 | safety, cooking, weather, STEM | Medium — safety-relevant |
| `door` | phase 1 | home rooms, daily routines | Low |
| `table` | phase 1 | meals, home objects, daily routines | Low |
| `ball` | phase 1 | play/games, sports | Low |
| `rope` | phase 1 | play/games, tools | Low |

Fire is the only curriculum-only concept with safety relevance — other basic objects are low-risk since the curriculum covers them well.

### Priority 3: Weak anchors within existing wiki files

These concepts have wiki entries but the entries may be too abstract or come too late in their files:

| Concept | Current File | Issue | Recommendation |
|---------|--------------|-------|----------------|
| `category` | abstract_operators_entries.md | Very abstract; may not teach classification well | Entry exists but `categories_and_grouping_entries.md` now provides clearer anchor |
| `past / present / future` | time_entries.md | Good coverage but also echoed in logic_entries.md | Overlap flagged; recommend time file owns temporal meanings |
| `begin / middle / end` | SPLIT: logic + storytelling | Overlap flagged in ledger | Recommend storytelling owns narrative sense; logic owns abstract sequence sense |
| `eat / drink / sleep` | SPLIT: STEM + verbs | STEM owns as biological process; verbs owns as action | Clarify in trunk audit that both usages are intentional |

### Priority 4: Structural language that may need strengthening

These concepts support comprehension across the corpus but are not missing — they just need to be checked during the trunk audit:

| Concept | File | Check During Trunk Audit |
|---------|------|--------------------------|
| `more / less` | logic_entries.md | Confirm these are grounded with concrete examples |
| `part / whole` | logic_entries.md | Strong coverage — confirm stays clear |
| `same / different` | logic_entries.md | Strong coverage — confirm stays clear |
| `why / because` | communication_acts_and_language_entries.md, evidence_and_justification_entries.md | Check that causal connectives are explicitly taught |
| `if / then` | logic_entries.md | Covered — confirm entry is child-accessible |

### Not comprehension-critical (low priority)

These curriculum-only items were flagged in the ledger but do not cause comprehension gaps:

- Basic objects: `stick`, `block`, `doll`, `sandbox`, `seesaw`, `hook`, `brick`
- These are well-covered in curriculum and are not heavily depended on by wiki files
- No wiki anchor is needed unless new files specifically require them

---

## Summary: Recommended Actions

1. **Add wiki anchors for:**
   - `thing` / `object` — foundational for "what is X?" structure
   - `word` and `sentence` — supports communication and story files
   - `idea` or `thought` — supports reasoning and reflection files

2. **Verify curriculum anchors for:**
   - `fire` — the only safety-relevant curriculum-only concept

3. **Resolve during trunk audit:**
   - begin/middle/end ownership (logic vs storytelling)
   - eat/drink/sleep ownership (STEM vs verbs)
   - past/present/future ownership (time vs logic)

4. **No action needed for:**
   - Basic curriculum objects (door, table, ball, etc.) — adequately grounded
   - ~15 curriculum-only items flagged in ledger — all low priority

## Next Steps

1. Review identified ownership overlaps during trunk audit (items 4-11 in todo list)
2. Confirm curriculum-only items are sufficiently grounded for comprehension
3. Use this ledger when adding new wiki content to avoid creating duplicate anchors
