- item: `Audit and normalize backlog dependencies, then build a corpus-wide dependency ledger from `wiki_category_backlog.md``
- summary: Created `dependency_ledger.md` containing a complete audit and normalization of all backlog dependencies. The ledger maps ~150 unique dependency concepts to their canonical wiki files, identifies ~15 curriculum-only dependencies (basic objects like door, table, ball), resolves all ~75 old `(backlog)` markers against current COVERED wiki files, and documents 9 ownership overlap hotspots (begin/middle/end, eat/drink/sleep, see/hear/smell, etc.) for the upcoming trunk audit. Zero missing dependencies were found — all backlog references now have grounded anchors.

- summary: Created `ranked_gap_list.md` containing 36 corpus comprehension gaps organized into 4 priority tiers. Tier 1 (Critical, 4 items) identifies foundational concepts needing wiki anchors: `thing`/`object`, `word`, `sentence`, and `idea`/`thought`. Tier 2 (Important, 8 items) lists ownership splits to resolve during the trunk audit. Tier 3 (Useful, 10 items) flags existing anchors to verify. Tier 4 (Low priority, 14 items) confirms curriculum-only basics need no action. Updated the todo file to mark item 3 complete with detailed notes and added a reference to the new gap list file.

Prose simplicity passed review. However, the file contains a difficulty stratification issue: problems escalate from Level 1-appropriate numbers (0-15) through Level 1/2 bridge content (10-100) to Level 2/3 content with 3-4 digit numbers (100-2000+), which exceeds the scope of `mathematical_concepts_entries.md` (which only covers 0-10).

  SUMMARY: Created `story_layer_rules.md` with comprehensive rules for Story Layers 1-4, including sentence-length targets (Layer 1: 5-10 words, Layer 2: 8-15, Layer 3: 10-18, Layer 4: 12-20), a five-dimension cognitive-load framework (sentence length, concept count, causation, temporality, contrast), truthfulness rules covering certainty, "I don't know," lookup/ask-for-help, and uncertainty-not-worth-pursuing cases, a quality checklist with failure modes, and example prompts for external model story generation. The document is designed to serve as both a prompt/rubric when drafting stories in ChatGPT, Gemini, or local models and as a quality-assurance reference.

- summary: Documented the alternating wiki/story expansion cadence as a canonical rule. Added a comprehensive "Alternating Expansion Cadence (Canonical Rule)" section to `level1_finish_and_level2_start_plan.md` covering: the strict pattern (Wiki Level N → Story Layer N → Wiki Level N+1), four reasons for alternation (grounding before variation, reinforcement through context, controlled complexity growth, quality gates), a story-layer-to-wiki-level mapping table, connective tissue batch placement, explicit rules against skipping or front-loading story layers, and human review checkpoints. Also added a cross-reference summary in `docs/training_pipeline.md` Stage 7 and updated Level 2 start criteria to require Story Layer 1 completion.
