- todo file: `training_data/wiki/02_wiki_implementation_todo.md`
- item: `Audit and normalize backlog dependencies, then build a corpus-wide dependency ledger from `wiki_category_backlog.md``
- summary: Created `dependency_ledger.md` containing a complete audit and normalization of all backlog dependencies. The ledger maps ~150 unique dependency concepts to their canonical wiki files, identifies ~15 curriculum-only dependencies (basic objects like door, table, ball), resolves all ~75 old `(backlog)` markers against current COVERED wiki files, and documents 9 ownership overlap hotspots (begin/middle/end, eat/drink/sleep, see/hear/smell, etc.) for the upcoming trunk audit. Zero missing dependencies were found — all backlog references now have grounded anchors.

- todo file: `training_data/wiki/02_wiki_implementation_todo.md`
- item: `Produce a ranked gap list for the wiki corpus`
- summary: Created `ranked_gap_list.md` containing 36 corpus comprehension gaps organized into 4 priority tiers. Tier 1 (Critical, 4 items) identifies foundational concepts needing wiki anchors: `thing`/`object`, `word`, `sentence`, and `idea`/`thought`. Tier 2 (Important, 8 items) lists ownership splits to resolve during the trunk audit. Tier 3 (Useful, 10 items) flags existing anchors to verify. Tier 4 (Low priority, 14 items) confirms curriculum-only basics need no action. Updated the todo file to mark item 3 complete with detailed notes and added a reference to the new gap list file.
- changed files:
  - `training_data/wiki/ranked_gap_list.md`
- details:
  Both files are correctly created and updated. Let me provide the final report.

Identified two low-priority overlaps: `own`/`belong` with ownership_and_sharing_entries.md (both defensible but social file is stronger teaching home) and `memory` vs `remember`/`forget` in learning_memory (acceptable split between noun and verb forms).

- summary: Audited `time_entries.md` (35 entries) for sequence-language ownership overlap with `logic_entries.md` and `storytelling_and_narrative_structure_entries.md`. Found that begin/middle/end are correctly absent from time_entries (owned by logic and storytelling). The before/after/then concepts are defined in both time and storytelling files, but this is an intentional split: time owns temporal definitions while storytelling owns narrative connective usage. All calendar units, time-of-day vocabulary, tense markers, and frequency adverbs are uniquely owned by time_entries with no overlaps. No structural changes required.

- summary: Audited `verbs_entries.md` (77 entries) for duplicate specialist ownership. Found 5 duplicate anchors with STEM_entries.md (eat, drink, sleep, see, hear) but all represent intentional splits where STEM owns biological/perceptual function and verbs owns everyday action sense. Additional overlaps with learning_memory_and_metacognition (learn, remember, forget) use different question formats and are intentional redundancy. Push/pull and share have clean splits (noun vs verb, or different anchor wording). No structural changes required; all overlaps documented in the todo file notes.
