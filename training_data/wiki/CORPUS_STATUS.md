# Corpus Status

## What we're building

A Level 1 training corpus for the BDH (Baby Dragon Hatchling) language model.
Each entry follows this format:

```
[user]what is a X?
[assistant]5-6 simple sentences. Identity + 2-3 concrete facts + 1 contrast.
X is not Y.
```

**Target level:** simple child-facing language, roughly preschool to 1st grade in tone, with room to grow later. No jargon, no Latin taxonomy, no encyclopedic depth.
**Contrast rule:** Every entry ends with "X is not Y." Both X and Y must be defined somewhere in the corpus (no dangling contrasts).

### Clean earlier / low concern
These looked solid before the current cleanup sprint and were not major problem files.

### Still worth a future pass
These are not blockers, but they may still want style cleanup, dependency review, or expansion later.

| File | Notes |
|---|---|
| foods_vegetables_entries.md | Not touched in the current cleanup sprint |
| mathematical_problems_entries.md | Still likely wants prose simplification pass |
| STEM_entries.md | May still overlap with weather/light/ice concepts and could use later ownership review |
| logic_entries.md | May still overlap with time concepts (`past`, `present`, `future`) |
| space_entries.md | May still overlap with mathematical shape vocabulary |

## Design principles

- **Vocabulary dependency:** No word appears in a problem or entry before it has been defined elsewhere in the corpus.
- **Bidirectional contrasts:** If entry A says "A is not B", entry B should exist and ideally say "B is not A."
- **No computation math** in concept files. Math concepts file covers number/shape/operation as language. Math problems file covers grade 1 arithmetic with known vocabulary only.
- **Cross-domain linking:** Entries reference other domains naturally (e.g. professions link to tools, animals link to plants).
- **Clear concept ownership:** prefer one canonical `what is X?` home per concept whenever possible.
- **General before specific:** broader anchors should usually appear before narrower concepts inside a file.

## Known dangling contrasts

These words appear as contrast targets (`X is not Y`) but do not yet have their
own entry. Each one is a candidate for later expansion.

| Word | Appears in | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| tiger | animals_mammals | medium |
| magazine | school_life_and_learning | low |
| plastic | school_life_and_learning | low |
| fog | weather_and_celestial | medium |
| breeze | weather_and_celestial | low |
| lightning | weather_and_celestial | high |
| darkness | weather_and_celestial | medium |
| puddle | weather_and_celestial | low |
| climate | weather_and_celestial | low |
| raven | animals_birds | low |
| plantain | foods_fruits | low |
| numeral | mathematical_concepts | low |

## Next steps

1. Continue manual cleanup before large category expansion
2. Review untouched or partially touched files like `foods_vegetables_entries.md`
3. Run later dependency/contrast pass across the whole wiki
4. Expand missing categories only after existing files have clear identity and ownership
5. Use `wiki_implementation_todo.md` as the practical write queue and recurring anchor-review checklist
