# Training-Data Hourly Worker Log

> Cleaned 2026-04-25: removed misleading malformed-success entries that reported only "Claude Code completed the run." with no useful task result. Full raw log preserved in `archive/workflow/hourly_worker_log_pre_cleanup_2026-04-25.md`.

Completed the dependency pass for `community_places_and_services_entries.md`. Verified that all 16 entries (5/11 split) are grounded in existing anchors including professions, safety rules, health, transport, shopping, and school life. Updated the `wiki_entry_expansion_index.csv` with the dependency pass completion note. Verified that index files and history were already partially updated by a previous attempt, and ensured the implementation is now complete and correctly documented.

  I have completed the dependency pass for `community_places_and_services_entries.md`. I verified that all 16 entries (5/11 split) are grounded in existing anchors, including professions, safety rules, health, transport, shopping, and school life. I updated the `wiki_entry_expansion_index.csv` with the dependency pass completion note for all 16 entries, ensuring proper quoting for notes containing commas. While other index files and the project history were updated in a previous attempt, the CSV had been missed; the implementation is now complete and consistently documented.

  I have successfully audited and repaired `training_data/triplet_stories/tier_1/people_and_relationships.md` to align with the Tier 1 specification. The repairs involved removing all quoted dialogue, names, and first-person perspectives, ensuring each of the 20 stories strictly follows the 8-sentence structure with indirect narration. I have updated `todo.md` by moving the completed task to `history.md` and providing a detailed audit report.

  I have audited and repaired `training_data/triplet_stories/tier_1/home_and_daily_life.md` according to the Tier 1 specification. I rewrote all 20 stories to adhere to the eight-sentence structure, used third-person narration, removed all names and quoted dialogue, and ensured the inclusion of anchor and support concepts. Additionally, I converted the file into the required `[user]` / `[Ninereeds]` training-pair format and updated both `todo.md` and `history.md` to reflect these completions.

  SUMMARY: Created `training_data/triplet_stories/tier_2/people_and_relationships.md` with 20 Tier 2 stories in the repeated `[user]` / `[Ninereeds]` format. Each story is exactly 12 sentences long, uses Domain 7 triplets (People and Relationships), and incorporates named characters (reusing students from previous files and introducing new family, neighbor, and professional roles). Updated `training_data/triplet_stories/character_registry.md` with five new recurring characters and moved the completed task from `todo.md` to `history.md`.

  I have completed the assigned task and updated the necessary files. Specifically, I created `training_data/triplet_stories/tier_2/home_and_daily_life.md` with 20 detailed stories, each adhering to the 12-sentence requirement and incorporating named characters, mild obstacles, and dialogue. Furthermore, I have updated `todo.md` to reflect the task's completion, documented the progress in `history.md`, and added the new character-to-anchor mappings to `character_registry.md`.

  I've confirmed that the characters in the stories align with the registry. I also reviewed `vehicles_and_travel.md` for vocabulary and found that most words, including "driveway," "seatbelt," and "station," are appropriate for Tier 2. While some words like "aisle" or "scurries" might seem advanced, they appear suitable for this level. I've verified that all stories, including the "bus" story, consist of exactly 12 sentences. Since the task was previously marked as completed in both `todo.md` and `history.md`, I will now provide the final report in the required format to fulfill the "IMPORTANT RETRY" instruction.

  The Wiki Level 3 expansion for "Evidence and Justification" has been implemented. All four core concepts from the Level 2 source—justification, reason why, example, and "that proves"—were expanded into six cohesive prose sections. Each section contains between 150 and 250 words, incorporates mandatory connectives ("because," "so," "if...then," "but"), and includes explicit causal reasoning chains and logical contrasts, meeting all Level 3 requirements.

  STEP: 3 (Create Story Tier 3)
  SUMMARY: Created `training_data/triplet_stories/tier_3/weather_and_seasons.md` with 20 Tier 3 stories covering all weather and seasons anchors (rain, sun, snow, wind, cloud, rainbow, thunder, ice, puddle, snowball, snowflake, umbrella, coat, summer, winter, spring, fall, frost, sunny day, storm). Each story follows the Tier 3 spec: 8-12 sentences in 2-3 paragraphs, explicit cause-effect chains using "because" and "so", contrasts using "but" (max one per story), short elliptical dialogue where appropriate, and reused named characters from the Tier 2 character registry (Tess, Eli, Ivy, Cole, Nina, Jade, Max, Ben, Rosa, Owen, Mila, Pete, Gia, Kai, Zara, Amy, Wes, Eve, Hugo, Nate). Removed the completed task from `todo.md` and added the completion record to `history.md`.

During the audit, I identified that several sentences exceeded the 20-word limit and some sections lacked the mandatory "if...then" connective structure. I performed a comprehensive rewrite of all six sections to ensure strict compliance with the word count (300–500 words per section), sentence length (max 20 words), and connective requirements, while also minimizing passive voice and strengthening causal reasoning and explicit comparisons. The task is now complete, and the repository tracking files have been updated accordingly.

  SUMMARY: Created `training_data/triplet_stories/tier_4/animals_and_nature.md` with 20 stories in the repeated `[user]` / `[Ninereeds]` format. Each story follows Tier 4 requirements, including 10-15 sentences, 2-3 paragraphs, multiple causal links ("because", "so", "if...then"), and mandatory temporal markers ("first," "after," "finally"). Named characters from the Tier 2/3 registry were reused to maintain narrative consistency across tiers. Updated `todo.md` and `history.md` (task #83).
