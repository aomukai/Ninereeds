# MSM Pipeline

Design reference for the active autonomous training pipeline.

## Pipeline Shape

```text
orchestrator strategy
  -> executor selects the next phase-appropriate item from policy and writes one script
  -> trainer runs the script mechanically against Ninereeds
  -> raw chat log
  -> executor grades every scripted item
  -> executor either appends another script or escalates a report
  -> orchestrator decides strategy only when needed
  -> optional approved micro-update / probe / replay / scan / escalation
```

The active loop is cold-start, phase-gated, and epochless. One script is the smallest
execution unit. Cold-start MSM starts from random weights and follows the phase contract in
`cold_start_phases.md`; each phase defines frontload data, evaluation probes, and success
gates before the next phase can start.

Phase 0 and Phase 1 use a frontload block runner before ordinary MSM sessions are useful:

```text
phase policy -> generate examples -> train block -> probe -> block report
```

The current runner entry point is `meta/scripts/msm_phase_runner.py`.

## Components

### Orchestrator

Strategic owner. Reads report cards and state, chooses policy, and writes bounded plans.

Required outputs:

- campaign/session policy JSON
- strategic decision JSON when escalation occurs
- human-attention sentinel when blocked

The orchestrator should spend reasoning tokens on strategy, not routine script execution or
routine grading. It is called when the executor reaches a stop condition, when update or
promotion decisions are ready, or when the policy boundary is exhausted.

### Executor

Tactical local model worker. Converts policy into scripts, reads raw logs, grades each
scripted item, writes reports, and extracts proposed training turns.

Candidate local executor models:

- `gemma4-26b-a4b`
- `qwen3.6-36b-a3b`

Quality matters more than throughput. The executor should be evaluated by script quality,
grading reliability, and ability to escalate at the right time.

Executor selection is fixed in v1. The orchestrator may call a `select_executor` helper,
but it must currently return the configured default executor. Do not implement UCB or
bandit executor routing until there are multiple real backends with comparable outcome
data.

Required outputs:

- `script.json`
- `turn_grades.jsonl`
- `report_card.json`
- `report.md`
- optional `proposed_training.jsonl`

Each `script.json` records executor ID, selection method, whether `meta_scratchpad.md`
was injected, and a deterministic script fingerprint. The fingerprint uses normalized
text, question-type sequence, contrast pairs, and target failure modes. It is deliberately
not embedding-based in v1.

### Trainer

Deterministic runner. The trainer may be a Python script. It does not need to be a model.

The trainer executes fixed scripts only:

1. send the scripted user prompt to Ninereeds
2. record Ninereeds' answer
3. print or send the scripted correction/teacher line
4. record the follow-up Ninereeds answer when the script asks for one
5. write a clean `raw_chat.jsonl`

The trainer must not grade, summarize, choose a next question, or alter the script.

### Hermes

Notification and watchdog layer. Posts Discord reports and pings the user when a sentinel
file appears.

Hermes is a pager, not an agent. It may poll sentinel files, trainbox reachability,
heartbeat freshness, disk/GPU status, and compact JSON/MD state files. It must not rewrite
plans, approve updates, promote checkpoints, repair corpus files, mutate concept state, or
run broad repository analysis.

### Codex Brake

Codex should run inside a tmux session named `codex` when the autonomous loop is active:

```bash
tmux new -s codex 'cd ~/Ninereeds && codex'
```

Use Codex `/statusline` only to configure what the interactive `/status` display shows.
The visible status should include rate limits, token counters, context stats, session ID,
and project root. The watchdog observes the pane passively:

```bash
python3 meta/scripts/watch_codex_status.py
```

The watchdog writes `training/pipeline/msm/state/codex_status.json`,
`training/pipeline/msm/state/codex_status.md`, and `training/pipeline/msm/state/codex_brake.json`.
`codex_status.json` is observational. `codex_brake.json` is normative and must be read
before starting a new orchestration boundary.

Do not monitor by sending `/status` or `/statusline` into the live Codex session. The
watchdog should only use `tmux capture-pane` against already-visible output.

Brake actions:

- `continue` - proceed normally.
- `conservative_mode` - skip optional probes, cleanup, broad scans, and exploratory work.
- `finish_current_only` - finish the current safe boundary, persist state, then stop or
  sleep.
- `pause_until_reset` - do not launch sessions, call executor for new work, or apply
  updates until reset is confirmed.
- `blocked_unknown_reset` - preserve or write `BLOCKED` and stop.

Schemas:

- `training/pipeline/codex_status_schema.json`
- `training/pipeline/codex_brake_schema.json`
- `training/pipeline/cold_start_phase_schema.json`

### Auto-Advance Policy

Codex/orchestrator may authorize bounded executor auto-advance through:

- `training/pipeline/msm/state/active_campaign_policy.json`
- `training/pipeline/msm/state/word_queue.json`
- `training/pipeline/msm/state/auto_advance_state.json`
- `training/pipeline/msm/state/concept_state.json`
- `training/pipeline/msm/state/session_archive.json`

The executor follows the word queue and writes one script at a time. After grading a
script, it may append another script for the same word only while all of these remain true:

- at least one scripted item has a correct original answer or correct post-correction
  answer
- no answer is off-topic
- the retry/script budget for the word is not exhausted
- no protected-anchor, malformed-output, artifact-conflict, or brake condition blocks work

The executor must escalate to the orchestrator when any of these occur:

- no scripted item receives a correct answer
- at least one answer is off-topic
- the same failure repeats beyond retry limits
- protected anchors fail
- an update/promotion decision is ready
- artifacts conflict or grading uncertainty is high
- the queue is exhausted
- the Codex brake blocks new work

Allowed executor actions:

- `PASS_AUTONEXT`
- `PASS_BUT_BUFFER`
- `RETRY_SAME_WORD`
- `ESCALATE_CODEX`
- `ESCALATE_HUMAN`

Scheduler scoring should use accumulated state when available:

```text
score = learnability + severity + underexplored_bonus - retry_penalty
```

Protected anchors may add a separate priority weight, but protected-anchor failures still
block promotion rather than acting like ordinary failed cards.

Schemas:

- `training/pipeline/active_campaign_policy_schema.json`
- `training/pipeline/word_queue_schema.json`
- `training/pipeline/auto_advance_state_schema.json`

## Session Lifecycle

The canonical executable step sequence is `runbook.md`. This lifecycle is a design map,
not a second runbook.

1. **Plan** - orchestrator sets campaign policy, word queue, limits, and escalation rules.
2. **Script** - executor writes one exact prompt/correction script for one word/card.
3. **Execute** - trainer runs the script against Ninereeds and logs all turns.
4. **Grade** - executor grades each scripted item individually.
5. **Auto-advance or escalate** - executor appends another script only if policy permits.
6. **Decide** - orchestrator handles escalations, updates, promotion, repair, or user asks.
7. **Update** - optional buffered micro-update from orchestrator-approved turns only.
8. **Gate** - protected anchors and target checks determine promotion.

---

## Sentinel Files

Canonical names are defined in `sentinel_files.md`:

- `HUMAN_ATTENTION` - user action required
- `BLOCKED` - automation cannot continue safely
- `TRAINING_MACHINE_DOWN` - local runner unavailable
- `API_CREDITS_EXHAUSTED` - paid API worker cannot continue
- `PROMOTION_REVIEW_REQUIRED` - update candidate needs manual approval

Hermes watches for sentinel files and pings the user.

---

## Update Backend

Initial implementation: buffered micro-updates.

Invocation contract:

```bash
python3 meta/scripts/msm_micro_update.py --manifest training/pipeline/msm/updates/UPDATE_ID/update_manifest.json
```

If that script does not exist yet, the orchestrator must write `BLOCKED` and request
implementation. Update artifact schemas are defined in `update_artifact_schema.md`.
Thresholds and buffer triggers are defined by `msm_config.md`.

The rest of the pipeline must treat update execution as a backend. Later backends may
support true online Hebbian updates, but logs, report cards, and orchestrator decisions
should not depend on that implementation detail.

---

## Deprecated Pipeline

The old campaign runner flow trained corpus files for fixed epoch counts and selected
winners from eval/brain-map metrics. That flow is archived as historical infrastructure.

Use it only for explicit comparison experiments.
