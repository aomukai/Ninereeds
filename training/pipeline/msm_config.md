# MSM Configuration Contract

The active config file should live at:

`training/pipeline/msm/state/orchestrator_config.json`

Machine-readable schema:

`training/pipeline/orchestrator_config_schema.json`

If the file does not exist yet, ordinary startup writes the static default with
`meta/scripts/msm_bootstrap_config.py` before autonomous sessions. The orchestrator should
only modify this config after recording an explicit decision.

Thresholds are starting defaults, not research findings. The orchestrator may change them
only by writing an explicit decision artifact.

`executor_prompt_context.inject_meta_scratchpad` defaults to `false`. The meta scratchpad
is an ablation-controlled prompt input, not required infrastructure. Every generated
`script.json` must record whether the scratchpad was injected.

`executor_selection.selection_mode` is fixed in v1. The helper interface may exist, but
there is no UCB/bandit selection until multiple executor backends have enough comparable
evidence.

Script de-duplication uses deterministic fingerprints in v1: normalized prompt hashes,
question-type sequences, contrast pairs, and target failure modes. Do not add an embedding
model to this path unless the orchestrator explicitly approves a later experiment.

## Buffer Location

Approved buffers live under:

`training/pipeline/msm/buffers/BUFFER_ID/approved_training.jsonl`

The executor never writes this file directly. The orchestrator creates it by selecting records
from one or more `proposed_training.jsonl` files.

An update manifest must not be written unless the approved buffer contains at least
`min_approved_turns_for_update` records.

## Accumulated Evidence

The orchestrator should maintain:

- `training/pipeline/msm/state/phase_registry.json`
- `training/pipeline/msm/state/concept_state.json`
- `training/pipeline/msm/state/session_archive.json`

`phase_registry.json` is the source of truth for the active phase and canonical phase
sequence. `concept_state.json` accumulates card-level and axis-level attempts, successes,
failures, retry counts, last strategy, and last session. `session_archive.json` is a
queryable index of report-card summaries and script fingerprints. The full report
artifacts remain under `training/pipeline/msm/sessions/SESSION_ID/`.

During Phase 0/1 frontload blocks, the local runner may update
`checkpoint_policy.current_parent` to the latest successfully probed block checkpoint so the
next local block continues training instead of restarting from `scratch`. The orchestrator
still owns phase promotion and `accepted_checkpoint`.

## Cold-Start Block Runner

Phase 0 and Phase 1 use a frontload block loop, not the later MSM session loop:

```text
generate examples -> train bounded block -> probe -> write phase block report
```

The runner entry point is:

```bash
python3 meta/scripts/msm_phase_runner.py
```

When the current parent is `scratch`, the runner must call `train.py` without `--resume`.
No explicit scratch checkpoint file is required. After a successfully probed Phase 0/1 block,
later local blocks resume from `checkpoint_policy.current_parent`. The orchestrator promotes
or rejects a phase only after reviewing the gate report.
