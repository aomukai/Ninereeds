# MSM Orchestrator Startup

This is the master wake-up file for the stateless cold-start MSM pipeline.

The orchestrator has no hidden memory. On every wake-up, reconstruct state from explicit
artifacts, decide the next safe boundary, write the decision artifact, then stop or hand
work to a deterministic runner.

---

## Startup Order

Read these in order:

1. `CLAUDE.md`
2. `index.md`
3. `todo.md`
4. `training/pipeline/orchestrator_startup.md`
5. `training/pipeline/runbook.md`
6. `training/pipeline/cold_start_phases.md`
7. `training/pipeline/msm_config.md`
8. `training/pipeline/msm/state/phase_registry.json`

Then run or read the deterministic startup summary:

```bash
python3 meta/scripts/msm_orchestrator_status.py
```

The summary is advisory. JSON/report artifacts remain the source of truth.

---

## Required Artifact Reads

Always check:

- `training/pipeline/msm/state/phase_registry.json`
- `training/pipeline/msm/state/orchestrator_config.json` if present
- `training/pipeline/msm/state/codex_brake.json` if present
- sentinel files anywhere under `training/pipeline/msm/`
- latest phase block reports under `training/pipeline/msm/phase_blocks/`
- latest session report cards under `training/pipeline/msm/sessions/`
- latest update evals under `training/pipeline/msm/updates/`

Read derived indexes only after source reports:

- `training/pipeline/msm/state/concept_state.json`
- `training/pipeline/msm/state/session_archive.json`

If a derived index conflicts with source reports, prefer the source report.

---

## Wake Reasons

Classify why the orchestrator woke up:

- `manual_start` - user started the pipeline or asked for status.
- `no_config` - `orchestrator_config.json` is missing and must be created from the
  config contract.
- `no_block_yet` - current phase has no block report yet.
- `block_finished` - a phase block report exists and needs a decision.
- `block_failed` - block report or runner status is failed/blocked.
- `gate_review` - local report says phase gate may be met.
- `sentinel_present` - human/Codex attention sentinel exists.
- `brake_blocks` - Codex brake disallows new work.
- `update_review` - update candidate requires acceptance/rejection.

Write the wake reason into the next decision/log artifact.

---

## Decision Boundaries

The orchestrator may decide:

- create missing `orchestrator_config.json`
- run a cold-start phase block with `meta/scripts/msm_phase_runner.py`
- repeat the same phase with adjusted block policy
- request probe implementation or repair a runner failure
- mark phase gate for manual review
- advance to the next phase after gates pass
- stop because sentinel/brake blocks work

Do not run open-ended loops inside the orchestrator. The orchestrator sets bounded policy;
deterministic runners do the repetitive work.

---

## Kickoff Model

The recommended launch shape is:

```text
supervisor process
  -> calls deterministic status helper
  -> calls orchestrator at decision boundary
  -> orchestrator writes decision
  -> supervisor calls runner for bounded block
  -> runner writes report
  -> supervisor wakes orchestrator again
```

For early manual operation, it is acceptable to keep an orchestrator terminal open. For
24/7 operation, prefer a small Python supervisor that invokes Codex/orchestrator only at
decision boundaries. Do not keep Codex responsible for watching every training micro-step.

## Manual Start Or Restart

From the repository root, run:

```bash
meta/scripts/wake_msm_orchestrator.sh
```

This is safe after a clean start, crash, reboot, or power outage. The script starts a fresh
ephemeral `codex-fugu exec` turn, points it at this startup contract, and closes stdin so it
can run from a terminal, cron, or a future supervisor.

On wake-up, the orchestrator must reconstruct state from disk, run:

```bash
python3 meta/scripts/msm_orchestrator_status.py
```

Then it takes only the next safe bounded action. If the status helper says
`create_orchestrator_config`, the orchestrator should create
`training/pipeline/msm/state/orchestrator_config.json` and stop or report the next command.
If it says a phase block is ready, the orchestrator should hand off a bounded
`msm_phase_runner.py` command rather than staying alive as a watcher.

For a fully unattended reboot later, make the machine start a supervisor service that runs
this same wake script at decision boundaries. The wake script is the orchestrator entrypoint;
the supervisor is only the process manager.

---

## First Cold-Start Boundary

For `phase_0_form`, if no block report exists and no sentinel/brake blocks work, the next
safe action is usually a dry or live bounded block:

```bash
python3 meta/scripts/msm_phase_runner.py --phase-id phase_0_form --parent scratch
```

The runner omits `--resume` when parent is `scratch`; no scratch checkpoint file is
required.
