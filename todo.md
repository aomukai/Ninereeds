# TODO

Active work queue. See `training/docs/training.md` for the full procedure.
Completed phases: `archive/milestones/2026-05-29_corpus_milestone.md`.

## Nomenclature

**Campaign** = one experimental run covering one or more training phases.
A campaign ends when all planned phases complete or a regression warrants stopping.
Reports live in `training/logs/campaign_N_reports/`, named `NN_phase_X.md`.

---

## Campaign 13 — COMPLETE

**Result:** Bridge → Phase A → Phase C = shaped **0.925** (25M)
**Final checkpoint:** `checkpoints/c13_Phase_C_winner.pt`
**Report:** `training/logs/campaign_13_reports/orchestrator_log.md`

### Findings

- Bridge as cold-start primer: **+0.007** (Fresh → Bridge → Phase A beat Phase A-only)
- Bridge as between-phase connector: **-0.008 to -0.018** (consistently hurt — do not use)
- Phase C (agents & social) absorbed cleanly after Phase A (+0.004)
- Phase B (emotions/movement), D (cognitive verbs/time), E (abstraction/math): all permanently failed after 4 attempts each
- Extension pass confirmed: 0.925 is the ceiling for this curriculum on 25M

### Why B/D/E failed

Phase B contains 400+ emotion and desire-verb units — relational and temporal, incompatible
with the static-property phase format without narrative grounding.
Phase D (think/know/time/truth) and Phase E (abstraction/math) have the same problem at greater depth.

---

## Campaign 14 — Grounded stories + Phase B retry

**Goal:** Introduce grounded stories on top of the C13 winner, then retry Phase B and D.
Hypothesis: narrative context gives emotions and cognitive verbs the grounding they need.

**Model:** 25M (validate) → 150M (if 25M confirms)
**Base checkpoint:** `checkpoints/c13_Phase_C_winner.pt` (shaped 0.925)

### Immediate next steps

- [ ] Train grounded stories (interleaved, ≤5% of corpus) on C13 winner
- [ ] Eval: does shaped score hold or improve?
- [ ] Retry Phase B (emotions/movement) from stories checkpoint
- [ ] Retry Phase D (cognitive verbs) from stories checkpoint
- [ ] If B or D absorb: retry Phase E (abstraction/math) — needs arithmetic_bridge first

## Standing work (lower urgency)

- [ ] Phase I — Corpus critic (`meta/scripts/corpus_critic.py`) — before any full-scale campaign
- [ ] Phase E — Wiki splitting (for finer curriculum ordering)
- [ ] Phase H — Ordering manifests (depends on Phase E)
- [ ] Fix `allowlist_rank` not propagating into JSONL units (cosmetic; doesn't affect training order)
