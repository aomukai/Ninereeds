# The Lab

The Lab is a workstation-side observer for Ninereeds training artifacts.
It is intentionally outside the training pipeline.

## High-Level Architecture

The training machine owns generation:

- corpus generation
- training and evaluation
- MRI, Atlas, trace, report, and checkpoint generation
- artifact publication by `git push`

The Lab owns observation:

- periodic `git pull` on the workstation clone
- artifact discovery and indexing
- browser UI and PWA shell
- local message files for Inbox / Outbox provenance
- checkpoint publication for chat selection
- orchestrator chat requests through a remote API

The training machine never serves UI, answers chat, exposes APIs, or accepts SSH
operations from The Lab. The Lab always works from local files after git sync.

## Critical Review And Refinement

The first risk is accidental coupling through repository writes. Messages are
intended to be provenance files, but writing them into the same git worktree can
make `git pull` unsafe. The implementation therefore confines Lab writes to
`lab/messages/outbox`, `lab/state`, and `lab/published`, and the git pull service
uses `git pull --ff-only` with a short timeout. By default it skips automatic
pulls when unrelated local changes exist.

The second risk is artifact format churn. Current artifacts are spread across
`training/logs`, `training/corpus`, `runs`, `checkpoints`, and `chat/logs`, with
names such as `c17_ladder_1200_e4.md` and `c16_e5_redesign_current_atlas.html`.
The Lab does not assume a single canonical campaign folder. It indexes files by
generic artifact traits: extension, filename hints, campaign id, epoch id, mtime,
and optional metadata files. If later campaigns publish `metadata.json` folders,
those can be folded into the same interface without changing page code.

The third risk is resource creep. The Lab must not consume GPU or training
capacity. The initial server uses only standard-library Python, never imports
training modules, never loads checkpoints into GPU memory, and treats published
chat builds as file references. Real local Ninereeds inference should remain an
adapter behind `backend/chat`, with CPU-only and explicit opt-in safeguards.

The fourth risk is remote-orchestrator ambiguity. The orchestrator is modeled as
an HTTP API client and receives context assembled from local artifacts. If no
remote endpoint is configured, the Lab returns a clear disabled response instead
of starting a local process or connecting to the training machine.

## Backend Architecture

`backend/git`
: guarded fast-forward pull service and status reporting.

`backend/artifacts`
: repository scanner, artifact classifier, campaign grouping, timeline builder,
search index, and raw artifact serving.

`backend/chat`
: published-build registry and chat-mode adapters. The initial Ninereeds adapter
is a safe stub that references checkpoints without loading them.

`backend/orchestrator`
: remote API client. It builds compact artifact context and calls the configured
endpoint.

`backend/notifications`
: in-process event hub with Server-Sent Events and a minimal WebSocket broadcast
endpoint for browsers.

`backend/messages`
: Inbox / Outbox file store under `lab/messages`. Messages are markdown files
with JSON sidecars optional.

`backend/api`
: HTTP route handlers. Route handlers depend on service interfaces rather than
artifact path conventions.

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a static PWA:

- `dashboard`: current campaign, latest report/MRI/Atlas, bottleneck, latest
  decision, published build, running jobs
- `timeline`: expandable event feed from the artifact index
- `campaigns`: campaign list and same-campaign navigation
- `reports`: markdown rendering
- `atlas` and `mri`: iframe/raw serving of existing HTML visualizations
- `chat`: mode switch for Ninereeds checkpoint references and remote
  orchestrator calls
- `messages`: Inbox / Outbox
- `settings`: sync status, notification state, API configuration visibility

Mobile priority order is Timeline, Dashboard, Messages, Notifications, Chat,
MRI, then Atlas. The desktop layout exposes more panels at once, but the same
routes and components are used.

## Artifact Interfaces

## REST API

- `GET /api/status`
- `POST /api/git/pull`
- `GET /api/artifacts`
- `GET /api/artifacts/{id}`
- `GET /api/artifacts/{id}/content`
- `GET /api/campaigns`
- `GET /api/campaigns/{id}`
- `GET /api/timeline`
- `GET /api/search?q=...`
- `GET /api/messages?box=inbox|outbox`
- `POST /api/messages/outbox`
- `GET /api/builds`
- `POST /api/builds/publish`
- `POST /api/chat/ninereeds`
- `POST /api/chat/orchestrator`
- `GET /api/events` for Server-Sent Events
- `GET /repo/{repo_relative_path}` for safe raw artifact serving

## WebSocket API

`GET /ws` upgrades to a WebSocket. Broadcast messages use this shape:

```json
{"type":"artifact_indexed","payload":{"artifact_id":"...","title":"..."}}
```

The PWA uses Server-Sent Events first because they are sufficient for Lab-side
notifications and simpler to proxy. WebSocket support is present for future
bidirectional features.

## PWA Design

The PWA shell is static and cacheable. Dynamic data comes from API calls.
Notification permission is requested by the user from Settings. Push-like
browser notifications are generated from the event stream when the page is open;
true background push can be added later with a VAPID-backed push service.

The app remains useful offline for previously cached shell assets, but artifact
content requires local server access.

## Implementation Plan

1. Build the artifact indexer and campaign/timeline abstractions.
2. Add guarded git pull and scan scheduling.
3. Add message file store and event notifications.
4. Add published build registry and chat stubs.
5. Add remote orchestrator adapter with local artifact context.
6. Build the PWA shell around Dashboard, Timeline, Campaigns, Messages, Search,
   Artifact viewer, Chat, and Settings.
7. Add tests for classifier/indexer behavior and API smoke paths.
