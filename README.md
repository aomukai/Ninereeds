# Ninereeds / BDH Cognitive OS

![BDH Cognitive OS](docs/BDH.png)

This repository has two closely related goals:

1. **Build Ninereeds** — a small Developmental Learner Model trained through explicit curriculum, chat evidence, repair, and protected-anchor checks.
2. **Build the future BDH Cognitive OS around it** — a runtime with artifacts, routing, LoRA/specialist paths, notifications, and offline consolidation once the model is ready for that layer.

Current center of gravity: **Mommy Says Machine (MSM)**, a session-based training pipeline. The old broad `corpus -> epochs -> eval -> winner` campaign loop is now historical infrastructure, not the active procedure.

---

## What Kind Of Model Is This

Ninereeds is a **Developmental Learner Model (DLM)**, not a web-scale LLM.

The distinction matters:

- It is small, (around 25M, 150M, 604M, 1.2B parameters), so every malformed training example has outsized impact.
- The goal is not broad language coverage. The goal is stable concept identity, grounded contrasts, and reliable answers under retrieval pressure.
- Training is staged. Understanding, recalling, contrasting, and using a concept in richer contexts are treated as separate levels.
- Evaluation is evidence-driven: chat logs, report cards, protected anchors, grounding evals, and brain maps are used to decide the next intervention.

The model's proper name is **Ninereeds**, inspired by the dragon name in Terry Pratchett's *The Colour of Magic*. The architecture lineage comes from Pathway's Baby Dragon / BDH work, but Ninereeds is this project's individual model.

## Current State

Active regime as of 2026-07-01:

- **Training method:** MSM session training, not broad corpus pretraining.
- **Protected baseline:** `core/c17_contrast_angle_1200_e4.pt`.
- **Active work:** concept-card tutor loop, orchestration artifacts, schemas, sentinels, and the buffered micro-update backend.
- **Update backend:** `meta/scripts/msm_micro_update.py`.
- **Canonical runbook:** `training/pipeline/runbook.md`.
- **Historical campaign infrastructure:** archived under `archive/training_pipeline/`.

Do not continue from C17 repair branches unless an explicit recovery experiment chooses that path.

## Active MSM Pipeline

MSM is a closed-loop teaching pipeline, not one model:

```text
orchestrator plan
  -> DeepSeek script generation
  -> Gemma fixed-script execution
  -> raw chat log
  -> DeepSeek report card
  -> orchestrator decision
  -> optional replay / repair / probe / brain scan / buffered micro-update
```

The atomic unit is a **word/card session**. One session targets one concept or one repair objective. Raw chat logs are evidence only; they are never ingested directly as training data.

Roles:

- **Orchestrator** owns strategy, checkpoint protection, scheduling, update approval, and escalation.
- **DeepSeek Flash** writes bounded scripts, grades raw logs, fills report cards, and proposes trainable turns.
- **Gemma** executes fixed scripts mechanically against Ninereeds and writes raw logs.
- **Hermes** watches logs and sentinel files, then notifies the user when automation needs attention.

Only orchestrator-approved records copied into `approved_training.jsonl` may enter a micro-update.

When markdown and JSON disagree for a session, `report_card.json` is authoritative.

## Corpus And History

The completed corpus work still matters, but it is no longer the main active loop.

- `training_data/` contains generated curriculum sources: phases, language material, wiki-style knowledge, stories, identity/boundary material, and reasoning data.
- `training/corpus/` contains assembled campaign and update corpora.
- `training/corpus_admin/` contains manifests, probe sets, kernel format notes, and ordering files.
- `training/logs/` contains historical campaign reports, grounding evals, brain maps, and trace reports.
- `archive/training_pipeline/` contains the deprecated epoch-campaign flow and C17 campaign configs.

Use historical campaign files for evidence and comparison experiments. Do not treat them as the active training procedure.

## Core Rules

- Do not casually modify `bdh.py`.
- Do not casually modify checkpoint files in `core/`.
- Do not continue from C17 repair branches unless an explicit experiment chooses that path.
- Never train from raw chat logs.
- Never silently mutate weights during a run.
- Always write important outputs to disk.
- Keep report generation, orchestration decisions, and update approval as separate gates.
- Protected-anchor regression blocks promotion.

## Long-Term OS Direction

The future BDH Cognitive OS design lives in `docs/bdh_cognitive_os_design.md`.

That target architecture includes:

- core model plus specialist paths
- explicit routing and artifact-first execution
- future LoRA routing / registry
- clean-core reintegration
- offline consolidation workflows

Present-tense summary: **build Ninereeds first, then build BDH Cognitive OS around Ninereeds.**
